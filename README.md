# Quality research for Food Data

This repository stores code and supplementary material for study on the quality of food related data in consumer nutrition applications.


## Abstract

There is a need for developers of consumer nutrition applications to accumulate
food-related data. However, studies about the methods to assess the quality of
food related data are scarce. This study lays a foundation for further research into
quality of such data. The central part of the research is a way to solve merge
problem that occurs when trying to merge multiple datasets into one with minimal
number of duplicates. This study solves it using lexical similarity function. This
study also proposes a range of metrics that can be used to gauge quality of a dataset
and demonstrates their results
